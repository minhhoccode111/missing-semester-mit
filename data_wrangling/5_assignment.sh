# Look for boot messages that are not shared between your past three reboots
# (see journalctlâ€™s -b flag). Break this task down into multiple steps. First,
# find a way to get just the logs from the past three boots. There may be an
# applicable flag on the tool you use to extract the boot logs, or you can use
# sed '0,/STRING/d' to remove all lines previous to one that matches STRING.
# Next, remove any parts of the line that always varies (like the timestamp).
# Then, de-duplicate the input lines and keep a count of each one (uniq is your
# friend). And finally, eliminate any line whose count is 3 (since it was shared
# among all the boots).
