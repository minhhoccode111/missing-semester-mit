this is the vim macro to convert the file to json
just put it to a register and then execute it

example:
- put to `a` register:
V"ay
- execute the macro 250 times to finish (remember to increase the surround
  plugin limit to 1005 with `sn` and place the cursor on the `<` of `<person>`)
- then execute the macro to convert to json:
250@a
