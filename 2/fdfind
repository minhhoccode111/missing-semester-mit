FD(1)                       General Commands Manual                      FD(1)

NAME
       fd - find entries in the filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       fd  [-HIEsiaLp0hV]  [-d  depth] [-t filetype] [-e ext] [-E exclude] [-c
       when] [-j num] [-x cmd] [pattern] [path...]

DESCRIPTION
       fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find(1).

OPTIONS
       -H, --hidden
              Include hidden files and directories in the search results  (de‐
              fault:  hidden  files and directories are skipped). The flag can
              be overridden with '--no-hidden'.

       -I, --no-ignore
              Show search results from files and directories that would other‐
              wise be ignored by

              • .gitignore

              • .git/info/exclude

              • The  global  gitignore  configuration  (by default $HOME/.con‐
                fig/git/ignore)

              • .ignore

              • .fdignore

              • The global fd ignore file (usually $HOME/.config/fd/ignore )

              The flag can be overridden with '--ignore'.

       -u, --unrestricted
              Alias for '--no-ignore'. Can be repeated; '-uu' is an alias  for
              '--no-ignore --hidden'.

       --no-ignore-vcs
              Show search results from files and directories that would other‐
              wise  be  ignored  by  gitignore  files  including   .gitignore,
              .git/info/exclude,   and   the  global  gitignore  configuration
              (core.excludesFile git setting, which  defaults  to  $HOME/.con‐
              fig/git/ignore).   The  flag  can  be overridden with '--ignore-
              vcs'.

       --no-ignore-parent
              Show search results from files and directories that would other‐
              wise be ignored by gitignore files in parent directories.

       -s, --case-sensitive
              Perform a case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insen‐
              sitive searches, unless the pattern contains an uppercase  char‐
              acter (smart case).

       -i, --ignore-case
              Perform  a case-insensitive search. By default, fd uses case-in‐
              sensitive searches, unless the  pattern  contains  an  uppercase
              character (smart case).

       -g, --glob
              Perform  a  glob-based  search  instead  of a regular expression
              search.  If combined with the '--full-path' option, '**' can  be
              used to match multiple path components.

       --regex
              Perform a regular-expression based search (default). This can be
              used to override --glob.

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a  regular  ex‐
              pression.  Note that this also performs substring comparison. If
              you want to match on an exact filename, consider using '--glob'.

       -a, --absolute-path
              Shows the full path starting from the root as opposed  to  rela‐
              tive paths.  The flag can be overridden with '--relative-path'.

       -l, --list-details
              Use a detailed listing format like 'ls -l'. This is basically an
              alias for '--exec-batch ls -l' with  some  additional  'ls'  op‐
              tions.  This  can  be used to see more metadata, to show symlink
              targets and to achieve a deterministic sort order.

       -L, --follow
              By default, fd does not descend into symlinked directories.  Us‐
              ing  this  flag, symbolic links are also traversed. The flag can
              be overridden with '--no-follow'.

       -p, --full-path
              By default, the search pattern is only matched against the file‐
              name  (or  directory  name).  Using  this  flag,  the pattern is
              matched against the full path.

       -0, --print0
              Separate search results by the null character (instead  of  new‐
              lines). Useful for piping results to xargs.

       --max-results count
              Limit  the  number of search results to 'count' and quit immedi‐
              ately.

       -1     Limit the search to a single result and quit  immediately.  This
              is an alias for '--max-results=1'.

       -q, --quiet
              When  the  flag  is present, the program does not print anything
              and will instead exit with a code of 0 if there is at least  one
              search  result.   Otherwise,  the  exit code will be 1.  This is
              mainly for usage in scripts and can be faster than checking  for
              output  because  the search can be stopped early after the first
              match.  --has-results can be used as an alias.

       --show-errors
              Enable the display of filesystem errors for situations  such  as
              insufficient permissions or dead symlinks.

       --strip-cwd-prefix
              By  default, relative paths are prefixed with './' when the out‐
              put goes to a non interactive terminal (TTY). Use this  flag  to
              disable this behaviour.

       --one-file-system, --mount, --xdev
              By  default,  fd  will  traverse  the file system tree as far as
              other options dictate. With this flag, fd ensures that  it  does
              not descend into a different file system than the one it started
              in. Comparable to the -mount or -xdev filters of find(1).

       -h, --help
              Print help information.

       -V, --version
              Print version information.

       -d, --max-depth d
              Limit directory traversal to at most d levels of depth.  By  de‐
              fault, there is no limit on the search depth.

       --min-depth d
              Only  show search results starting at the given depth. See also:
              '--max-depth' and '--exact-depth'.

       --exact-depth d
              Only show search results at the exact given depth.  This  is  an
              alias for '--min-depth <depth> --max-depth <depth>'.

       --prune
              Do not traverse into matching directories.

       -t, --type filetype
              Filter search by type:

              f, file
                     regular files

              d, directory
                     directories

              l, symlink
                     symbolic links

              s, socket
                     sockets

              p, pipe
                     named pipes (FIFOs)

              x, executable
                     executable (files)

              e, empty
                     empty files or directories

              This  option can be specified more than once to include multiple
              file types.  Searching for '--type  file  --type  symlink'  will
              show both regular files as well as symlinks. Note that the 'exe‐
              cutable' and 'empty'  filters  work  differently:  '--type  exe‐
              cutable'  implies  '--type  file' by default. And '--type empty'
              searches for empty files and directories, unless either  '--type
              file' or '--type directory' is specified in addition.

              Examples:
                - Only search for files:
                    fd --type file …
                    fd -tf …
                - Find both files and symlinks
                    fd --type file --type symlink …
                    fd -tf -tl …
                - Find executable files:
                    fd --type executable
                    fd -tx
                - Find empty files:
                    fd --type empty --type file
                    fd -te -tf
                - Find empty directories:
                    fd --type empty --type directory
                    fd -te -td

       -e, --extension ext
              Filter search results by file extension ext.  This option can be
              used repeatedly to allow for multiple possible file extensions.

              If you want to search for files without extension, you  can  use
              the regex '^[^.]+$' as a normal search pattern.

       -E, --exclude pattern
              Exclude  files/directories  that  match  the given glob pattern.
              This overrides any other ignore logic.   Multiple  exclude  pat‐
              terns can be specified.  Examples:
                --exclude '*.pyc'
                --exclude node_modules

       --ignore-file path
              Add  a  custom  ignore-file in '.gitignore' format.  These files
              have a low precedence.

       -c, --color when
              Declare when to colorize search results:

              auto   Colorize output when standard output is connected to ter‐
                     minal (default).

              never  Do not colorize output.

              always Always colorize output.

       -j, --threads num
              Set number of threads to use for searching & executing (default:
              number of available CPU cores).

       -S, --size size
              Limit results based on  the  size  of  files  using  the  format
              <+-><NUM><UNIT>

              '+'    file size must be greater than or equal to this

              '-'    file size must be less than or equal to this

              If  neither  '+' nor '-' is specified, file size must be exactly
              equal to this.

              'NUM'  The numeric size (e.g. 500)

              'UNIT' The units for NUM. They are not case-sensitive.   Allowed
                     unit values:

                     'b'    bytes

                     'k'    kilobytes (base ten, 10^3 = 1000 bytes)

                     'm'    megabytes

                     'g'    gigabytes

                     't'    terabytes

                     'ki'   kibibytes (base two, 2^10 = 1024 bytes)

                     'mi'   mebibytes

                     'gi'   gibibytes

                     'ti'   tebibytes

       --changed-within date|duration
              Filter  results based on the file modification time.  Files with
              modification times greater than the argument will  be  returned.
              The  argument  can be provided as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min) or
              as a specific point in time in either full RFC3339  format  with
              time  zone,  or  as  a  date  or datetime in the local time zone
              (YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).  --change-newer-than can be
              used as an alias.

              Examples:
                --changed-within 2weeks
                --change-newer-than "2018-10-27 10:00:00"

       --changed-before date|duration
              Filter  results based on the file modification time.  Files with
              modification times less than the argument will be returned.  The
              argument  can be provided as a duration (10h, 1d, 35min) or as a
              specific point in time in either full RFC3339 format  with  time
              zone,  or as a date or datetime in the local time zone (YYYY-MM-
              DD or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).  --change-older-than can be used  as
              an alias.

              Examples:
                --changed-before "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
                --change-older-than 2weeks

       -o, --owner [user][:group]
              Filter    files    by   their   user   and/or   group.   Format:
              [(user|uid)][:(group|gid)]. Either side is optional. Precede ei‐
              ther side with a '!' to exclude files instead.

              Examples:
                --owner john
                --owner :students
                --owner "!john:students"

       --base-directory path
              Change the current working directory of fd to the provided path.
              This means that search results will be shown with respect to the
              given base path. Note that relative paths which are passed to fd
              via the positional path argument  or  the  --search-path  option
              will also be resolved relative to this directory.

       --path-separator separator
              Set  the path separator to use when printing file paths. The de‐
              fault is the OS-specific separator ('/' on  Unix,  '\'  on  Win‐
              dows).

       --search-path search-path
              Provide paths to search as an alternative to the positional path
              argument. Changes the usage to ´fd [FLAGS/OPTIONS] --search-path
              PATH --search-path PATH2 [PATTERN]´

       -x, --exec command
              Execute   command  for  each  search  result  in  parallel  (use
              --threads=1 for sequential command execution).

              Note that all subsequent positional arguments are considered  to
              be arguments to the command - not to fd.  It is therefore recom‐
              mended to place the -x/--exec option  last.  Alternatively,  you
              can  supply a ';' argument to end the argument list and continue
              with more fd options.  Most shells require ';'  to  be  escaped:
              '\;'.

              The following placeholders are substituted before the command is
              executed:

                     {}     path (of the current search result)

                     {/}    basename

                     {//}   parent directory

                     {.}    path without file extension

                     {/.}   basename without file extension

              If no placeholder is present, an implicit "{}" at the end is as‐
              sumed.

              Examples:

                - find all *.zip files and unzip them:

                      fd -e zip -x unzip

                -  find  *.h  and *.cpp files and run "clang-format -i .." for
              each of them:

                      fd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i

                - Convert all *.jpg files to *.png files:

                      fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png

       -X, --exec-batch command
              Execute command once, with all search results as arguments.  One
              of  the following placeholders is substituted before the command
              is executed:

                     {}     path (of all search results)

                     {/}    basename

                     {//}   parent directory

                     {.}    path without file extension

                     {/.}   basename without file extension

              If no placeholder is present, an implicit "{}" at the end is as‐
              sumed.

              Examples:

                - Find all test_*.py files and open them in your favorite edi‐
              tor:

                      fd -g 'test_*.py' -X vim

                  Note that this executes a  single  "vim"  process  with  all
              search results as arguments.

                - Find all *.rs files and count the lines with "wc -l ...":

                      fd -e rs -X wc -l

       --batch-size size
              Maximum  number  of  arguments to pass to the command given with
              -X. If the number of results is greater than the given size, the
              command  given  with -X is run again with remaining arguments. A
              batch size of zero means there is no limit.

PATTERN SYNTAX
       The regular expression syntax used by fd is documented here:

           https://docs.rs/regex/1.0.0/regex/#syntax

       The glob syntax is documented here:

           https://docs.rs/globset/#syntax

ENVIRONMENT
       LS_COLORS
              Determines how to colorize search results, see dircolors(1).

       NO_COLOR
              Disables colorized output.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME, HOME
              Used to locate the global ignore  file.  If  XDG_CONFIG_HOME  is
              set, use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fd/ignore.  Otherwise, use $HOME/.con‐
              fig/fd/ignore.

EXAMPLES
       Find files and directories that match the pattern 'needle':
              $ fd needle

       Start a search in a given directory (/var/log):
              $ fd nginx /var/log

       Find all Python files (all files with the extension .py) in the current
       directory:
              $ fd -e py

       Open all search results with vim:
              $ fd pattern -X vim

       --batch-size size
              Pass  at  most  size arguments to each call to the command given
              with -X.
